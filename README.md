# Scalable-Crop-Yield-Mapper
This repository contains an R file which I developed for my honors thesis, that is part of the implementation of a scalable crop yield mapper using DSSAT. This data is from three maize fields in Sutton, MA. Data was collected through Arable mark sensors and a UAV. Some of the code in this file comes from Sitian Xe.
